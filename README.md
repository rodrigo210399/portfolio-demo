# portfolio-demo

Repository created for exposition purposes. It contains sanitized reports and code demos showcasing my work in **data analytics, signal processing, and AI models** such as **Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs)**. 

## Repository Structure

- [**report-demo/**](./report-demo)  
  - Includes a [PDF report](./report-demo/showcase_report.pdf) that demonstrates my ability to write professional and detailed technical documents using LaTeX.  
  - Contains the corresponding Jupyter Notebook ([`report-code-demo.ipynb`](./report-demo/report-code-demo.ipynb)) used to generate the results presented in the report.

- [**code-experience-demo/**](./code-experience-demo)  
  - Includes three Jupyter Notebooks:  
    1. [**Data Cleaning**](./code-experience-demo/01-cleaning-demo.ipynb) ‚Äì applying multiple techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.  
    2. [**Data Preprocessing**](./code-experience-demo/02-preprocessing-demo.ipynb) ‚Äì transforming, normalizing, and encoding data to adapt to different use cases.  
    3. [**STGNN Model**](./code-experience-demo/03-stgnn-model-demo.ipynb) ‚Äì implementation of a Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network, including model training and performance evaluation results.
