# portfolio-demo

Repository created for exposition purposes. It contains sanitized reports and code demos showcasing my work in **data analytics, signal processing, and AI models** such as **Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs)**. 

## Repository Structure

- **report-demo/**
  - Includes a PDF report that demonstrates my ability to write professional and detailed technical documents using LaTeX.
  - Contains the corresponding Jupyter Notebook (`report-demo-code.ipynb`) used to generate the results presented in the report.

- **code-experience-demo/**
  - Includes three Jupyter Notebooks:
    1. **Data Cleaning** – applying multiple techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
    2. **Data Preprocessing** – transforming, normalizing, and encoding data to adapt to different use cases.  
    3. **STGNN Model** – implementation of a Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network, including model training and performance evaluation results.
