# Code Experience Demo

This folder includes three Jupyter Notebooks:  

1. **Data Cleaning** – demonstrates handling of missing values, outliers, and noisy records.  
2. **Data Preprocessing** – shows techniques such as normalization, feature engineering, and categorical encoding.  
3. **STGNN Model** – implementation of a Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN), with training and evaluation results (MAE, RMSE, R²).
