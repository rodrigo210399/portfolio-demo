# Report Demo

This folder includes a **technical report** and the corresponding code used to generate its results and figures:

- [**showcase_report.pdf**](./showcase_report.pdf) – a professional report written in LaTeX, demonstrating my ability to document technical work clearly and in detail.  
- [**report-code-demo.ipynb**](./report-code-demo.ipynb) – the Jupyter Notebook used to generate the data analysis, plots, and results presented in the report.

This demo illustrates both my **technical writing skills** (LaTeX, structured reporting) and my **coding/analysis workflow** (Python, Jupyter).
